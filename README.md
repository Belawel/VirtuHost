# VirtuHost

VirtuHost is a hands-on Windows Server lab that simulates a small enterprise Active Directory environment. The goal is to practice and document real-world Windows administration: identity, policy, file services, access control, replication, and security auditing.

## What’s included
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) with OU structure and group-based access (IGDLA)
- DNS/DHCP configuration
- Group Policy (GPO): drive mappings, user/computer policies, and delegation
- File services: NTFS + share permissions, home folders, Access-Based Enumeration (ABE)
- DFS Namespace + DFS Replication
- Security auditing (e.g., file access events) and troubleshooting notes
- PowerShell scripts for automation and administration

## Repo structure (high level)
- `/Topologi` – diagrams / architecture notes
- `/Configurations` – step-by-step setup and configs
- `/PowerShell Scripts` – scripts used in the project
- `/troubleshooting` – issues + fixes recorded during build

## Purpose
This project is built to strengthen and showcase practical Windows Server / infrastructure skills through a documented, repeatable lab setup.
